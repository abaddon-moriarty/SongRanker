# SongRanker

## Overview
The TTDP Sorting Hat is a Python application that helps users rank their favorite TTDP (Tortured Poets Department) songs. The app presents users with pairs of songs and allows them to choose their preferred song from each pair. Based on the user's choices, the app generates a ranking of the songs.

## Features
- Pairwise comparison mechanism for ranking songs.
- Random selection of song pairs to avoid bias.
- User-friendly interface for selecting preferred songs.
- Generates a ranking of songs based on user preferences.
- Option to export the results to a txt file at any point

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/abaddon-moriarty/SongRanker.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd SongRanker
```

## Usage
Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

Follow the instructions to choose your preferred song from each pair presented by the app.
The app will calculate the ranking as you go, which you can choose to display or hide.

## Future improvement
- [ ] Option to import a new list of songs and rank those.
- [ ] Adding little icons in the ranking (if you choose to display it) to see which song won or lost a place.
- [ ] the best thing would be to have a music snippet for each song, to be able to hear it before choosing, but that seems hard to do. I don't really know how to integrate spotify or equivalent.
